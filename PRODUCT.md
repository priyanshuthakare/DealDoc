# DealDoc — Product Details

> **"Real estate isn't about paperwork. It's about relationships. We built DealDoc to give agents their nights back."**

## 🏢 What is DealDoc?

DealDoc is an **AI-powered transaction coordinator** purpose-built for real estate professionals. It automates the most tedious parts of closing a deal — reviewing contracts, tracking deadlines, drafting emails, and managing compliance — so agents can focus on what actually grows their business: **building relationships and closing more deals.**

Think of it as having a tireless, hyper-accurate transaction coordinator working for you 24/7, at a fraction of the cost of a human TC.

## 🎯 Who Do We Help?

### Independent Real Estate Agents
Solo agents who are drowning in paperwork every night. If you're spending **3+ hours per transaction** on admin work instead of prospecting or showing homes, DealDoc was built for you.

### High-Volume Agents
Agents closing **4–15+ deals per month** who need a scalable system to manage the coordination chaos without hiring additional staff.

### Small Teams & Brokerages
Boutique real estate teams that need unified billing, admin dashboards, and consistent compliance across every agent's transactions.

### Transaction Coordinator Firms
TC professionals looking to **10× their throughput** by using AI to handle the repetitive scanning, tracking, and drafting — freeing them to manage more deals simultaneously.

### Primary Markets (at Launch)
- 🇺🇸 **California (CA)**
- 🇺🇸 **Texas (TX)**
- 🇺🇸 **Florida (FL)**
- *More states added monthly based on waitlist demand*

## 🔥 The Problem We Solve

Real estate agents spend **12+ hours per transaction** on coordination tasks. That's time stolen from prospecting, client meetings, and growing their business. Here are the biggest pain points DealDoc eliminates:

### 1. Missed Deadlines & TC Errors
One missed inspection date or double-booked closing can **kill a deal**. Forgotten contingency removals, expired loan approvals, or overlooked HOA deadlines lead to lost commissions and angry clients.

### 2. Hidden Document Gaps
Hours wasted chasing missing signatures, expired disclosures, and incomplete fields. A single unsigned addendum discovered at closing can delay a deal by weeks.

### 3. Sky-High Overhead Costs
Human transaction coordinators charge **$400–$500+ per deal**. For an agent closing 12 transactions per year, that's **$5,400–$6,000/year** just for coordination — on top of commission splits, MLS fees, and marketing costs.
